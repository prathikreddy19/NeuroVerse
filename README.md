# NeuroVerse
A personalized brain simulation framework that models an individual’s neural wiring and activity using rule-based dynamics, then applies targeted parameter modifications — such as drug effects — to observe and analyze changes in brain behavior, enabling safe, in-silico testing for neuroscience research and therapy design.
